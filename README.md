# StarDev - Company Website

A basic template for businesses to use to make their company website. Includes four responsive pages: Home, About, Work, Contact.

The Home Page is a simple page which introduces and provides the first glance to the website, and has a little bit of text.

The About Page contains more info about the company and more about the services that the business offers.

The Work Page is a portfolio page compiled of all the projects that the business has made/completed with a hover animation to view that project.

The Contact Page is a way for viewers to get in touch with the business by filling out a contact form, and contains contact information like address, phone number, and email.
